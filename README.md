# Inspiration

This is a continuation on my previous implementation of the snake game.

After implementing my first ever game, I was inspired to improve on it even more. I spoke with my professor and he recommended trying to explore the world of Machine Learning through this project. Machine Learning has always been a topic of my interest and throught this simple project I was able to understand many of its intricacies. 

Through this project I was able to able to use pytorch and keras modules for their Machine Learning model called Qnet. Implementing this model involed setting up a reward system for the agent to get better and improve.

# Challenges:

One of the major challeneges I faced was understanding the reward system and how the agent imporved. 
Another one of the challenges came in terms of its efficiancy. The model took about 80 games to get to a consistent score of 20+
This model is probably not the most optimal in terms of time but it was really good beginner model to get used to and understand.
